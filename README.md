## Fraud Detection System Using Data Visualization and Machine Learning

### Norbert Tom√†s Escudero (242695) Marc Sirvent Ruiz (240198)

The goal of this project is to build an integrated solution for detecting and preventing fraudulent financial transactions.

Our project focuses on answering the following questions:
- What trends and patterns are evident in transaction data, and how do they relate to fraudulent activity? (difference in trends and patterns from transaction data (non-fraudulent) and fraudulent)  
- Which features (e.g., transaction amount, card type, country) are the most important indicators of fraud? (Using SHAP on our predictive model of fraud) 
- How can we present insights and predictions in a user-friendly manner for decision-making? 

The results of this project will assist stakeholders in identifying fraud patterns through data-driven decisions.
