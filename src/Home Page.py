### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an integrated solution for detecting and preventing fraudulent financial transactions. 

Our project focuses on answering the following key questions:
1. **What trends and patterns are evident in transaction data, and how do they relate to fraudulent activity?**  
   - We analyze differences in trends and patterns between non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions.

2. **Which features are the most important indicators of fraud?**  
   - Using advanced techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we identify key features such as transaction amount, card type, and country.

3. **How can we present insights and predictions in a user-friendly manner for decision-making?**  
   - Through intuitive visualizations and dashboards.
